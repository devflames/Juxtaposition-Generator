# Juxtaposition Generator

Web application written in Python and JavaScript that generates combinations of comments from an adult video website and inspirational wallpapers from reddit.com. 

## Disclaimer

Any content generated from this application is not own, and is likely highly offensive. The comments and images rendered from scraping comment data do not represent my own opinions nor those of my employer. 


## Examples

Some very tame examples of the output:

![I could watch this all day](example_1.png?raw=true "I could watch this all day")

![Wow beautiful](example_2.png?raw=true "wow beautiful")


## Installation

Download the package as a zip or clone, then run the npm install 

* 'npm install'

If you don't have npm and/or node, follow the directions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). 

## Usage

Once node and npm are installed along with the dependencies covered in the step above, run: 

* 'node app.js' 

Then point your browser to [localhost port 3456](http://localhost:3456) and the app should be working. Initial startup is slow due to the python web scraping.
